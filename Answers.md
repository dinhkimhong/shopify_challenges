## Winter 2021 Data Science Intern Challenge 

Please complete the following questions, and provide your thought process/work. You can attach your work in a text file, link, etc. on the application page. Please ensure answers are easily visible for reviewers!


**Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set **

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

a.	Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
>	We calculated AOV without checking outliers which would turn our calculation wrong. We should remove outliers before calculating AOV.

>	Each store sells only one model of shoe, the price of products are different and user would purchase more than 1 product (place many orders in different stores) so to evaluate this data, I would like to calculate an average user spending.

b.	What metric would you report for this dataset?

> Average order value and average user spending

c.	What is its value?

> Average order value in March (exclude orders have outliers in total_items and unit_price): $300.00

> Average user spending in March (exclude orders have outliers in total_items and unit_price): $4,902.00

**Question 2: For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.**

a.	How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total? - **Answer: 54 orders**
```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Shippers.ShipperID = Orders.ShipperID
WHERE ShipperName = 'Speedy Express';
```
b.	What is the last name of the employee with the most orders? - **Answer: Peacock**
```
SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.LastName, COUNT(*) AS NumberOrders 
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Employees ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY NumberOrders DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
OR:
```
SELECT LastName, MAX(NumberOrders)
FROM 
  (SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.LastName, COUNT(*) AS NumberOrders FROM Orders
  LEFT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
  GROUP BY Employees.EmployeeID);
```
c.	What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany? - **Answer: Boston Crab Meat**
```
SELECT Products.ProductID, Products.ProductName, SUM(Quantity) as TotalQuantity 
FROM OrderDetails
LEFT JOIN Products ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
LEFT JOIN Customers ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
WHERE Customers.Country = 'Germany'
GROUP BY Products.ProductID
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
OR:
```
SELECT ProductName, MAX(TotalQuantity)
FROM 
  (SELECT Products.ProductID, Products.ProductName, SUM(Quantity) as TotalQuantity FROM OrderDetails
  LEFT JOIN Products ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID
  LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
  LEFT JOIN Customers ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
  WHERE Customers.Country = 'Germany'
  GROUP BY Products.ProductID);
  ```
